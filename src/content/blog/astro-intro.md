### Astro Framework

#### Page 1: Introduction to Astro

- Astro is a static site generator and a modern web framework that aims to combine the best of both static and dynamic web development.
- It allows developers to build websites that are fast, secure, and maintainable by generating static HTML at build time and enhancing it with JavaScript as needed.

#### Page 2: Key Features

- Astro offers a range of key features, including:
  - Incremental Static Generation (ISG): Generate pages on-demand, reducing build times.
  - Single-file components: Write components in a single file for easy organization.
  - Fast loading: Astro prioritizes performance with minimal JavaScript.
  - Framework agnostic: Use your preferred frontend framework or none at all.
  - Rich data loading: Fetch data at build time or on the client using Astro's data loading strategies.

#### Page 3: Getting Started

##### Installation

- To get started with Astro, install it using npm or yarn:
  ```
  npm install -g create-astro
  ```

##### Project Setup

- Create a new Astro project with:
  ```
  npx create-astro my-astro-project
  ```

##### Project Structure

- Astro projects typically have the following structure:
  ```
  - src/
    - components/
    - layouts/
    - pages/
  ```

#### Page 4: Building with Astro

##### Layouts and Components

- Layouts define the structure of your pages, while components encapsulate UI elements.
- Astro uses the `.astro` file extension for components and layouts.

##### Routing

- Astro supports file-based routing. Create files in the `pages` directory, and they become routes.
- For dynamic routes, use the `[name].astro` convention.

##### Data Loading

- Use Astro's data loading strategies to fetch data at build time or on the client.
- Strategies include `load`, `load-once`, and `load-everything`.

#### Page 5: Deployment and Optimization

##### Deployment

- Deploy your Astro site like any static website. Popular options include Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub Pages.

##### Optimization

- Astro prioritizes performance, but you can further optimize by:
  - Using responsive images with the `astro-image` component.
  - Lazy loading assets with the `loading` attribute.
  - Minifying CSS and JavaScript.
